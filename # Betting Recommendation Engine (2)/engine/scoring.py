engine/scoring.py
==================
Turns market odds + all graded factors into one number: model edge %.

Method (weighted-nudge-from-market):
  1. Convert American moneyline odds to implied probabilities.
  2. De-vig (remove the sportsbook's overround) to get a "fair" market
     probability for each side -- this is the number a bet needs to beat.
  3. Run every grading factor, each contributing +/- its configured weight
     (config.FACTOR_WEIGHTS) to a model probability that starts at the fair
     market number.
  4. edge_pct = model probability of the recommended side minus the fair
     market probability of that side.

This intentionally treats the market as the prior and factors as nudges,
because you told us there's no historical calibration yet. Once
backtest/grader.py has graded a few weeks of picks, revisit
config.FACTOR_WEIGHTS with what actually correlated with wins.
