"""
data/odds_providers.py
=======================
Moneyline/spread/total odds. Two implementations behind one interface:

- MockOddsProvider   : deterministic-per-day synthetic odds, zero setup.
- TheOddsApiProvider : real odds from https://the-odds-api.com, FanDuel book
  (your chosen sportsbook). Needs ODDS_API_KEY in .env.

config.ODDS_MODE picks which one get_odds_provider() hands back. Every
network path falls back to mock data on failure so a bad API response never
crashes the daily run -- it just degrades to synthetic odds for that game
(and logs a warning).
